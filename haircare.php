        <h1 class="second-topic">What is Haircare?</h1>
            <p class="second-para">The word "hair care" refers to all aspects of hygiene and cosmetology that deal with body hair, facial hair, pubic hair, and other hair that develops from the human scalp.
                    Depending on a person's culture and the physical attributes of their hair, several hair care regimens are used. Treatments including waxing, sugaring,
                    and threading allow for the coloring, trimming, removing, shaving, plucking,
                    and other modifications of hair. Salons, barbershops, and day spas provide hair care services, and there are also commercially available items for use at home.
                    Although these services are offered (in the US) by licensed specialists in medical offices or specialty spas, electrolysis and laser hair removal are also accessible.<br><br></p>

            <h1 class="topics">Why we need a good Haircare routine?</h1>
            <p class="content">We all need to take care of our hair on a daily basis. Our hair must be taken care of in the most basic manner since it is unfortunately frequently exposed to pollutants and grime. 
                Because it is the only thing that can help you accomplish your greatest hair goals, taking care of your hair is extremely important. Without the right monitoring, kids cannot grow hair that is long, healthy, 
                and beautiful.<br><br>
                First off, untidy, unkempt hair might give off an uneasy visual impression. Regular shampooing and proper lubrication are essential but insufficient. Undoubtedly, a balance must be maintained.
                To the fullest extent possible,
                one should be informed of which products should be used on the hair and which ones should be avoided. Extremely oily and dreadfully dry hair are both unappealing.<br><br></p>
            <h1 class="topics">Benefits of Haircare routine<div>
            <p class="content"><br>There is a list of advantages that come with regular haircare routines. Let's look at it.<br><br>
            <u> 01.Prevents hair loss</u><br><br>You are more likely to have less hair loss if you choose to use natural products and stop using ones that include chemicals.
                The next step is to strengthen your hair from the roots up, which is of utmost importance.
                If you regularly oil your hair, wash it, and condition it, you should be able to accomplish it.<br><br>
            <u>02.Increases hair volume</u><br><br> The thickness of a hair strand, not just its quantity, is what is meant by the term "hair volume."
                Hair that is thick always appears impressive and appealing. They imply that the hair's roots are firmly planted. Each person should regularly oil their hair.
                This will make room for hair strands that are stronger and thicker.
                Your hair will look nicer on the outside and be healthier on the inside if you follow a hair care regimen.<br><br>
            <u>03.Provides shine</u><br><br>If someone wants to appear beautiful, having lovely hair should be at the top of their priority list.
                The best hair treatments and serums may assist in giving your hair that shine. You are more likely to get that polished and glossy appearance 
                if you are careful to use hair serum after every wash.<br><br> 
            <u> 04.No issues with dandruff</u><br><br> White flakes in our hair have a way of lowering our confidence.
                However, if you take good care of your hair and give it enough moisture, you may quickly resolve dandruff-related problems. 
                Saying goodbye to the humiliation that dandruff causes is necessary for a healthy scalp.<br><br>

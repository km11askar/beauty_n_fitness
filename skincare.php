            <h1 class="first-topic">What is Skin Care?</h1>
            <p class="first-para">The art of caring for your skin is called skincare.
                Not only should you wash your face, 
                but you should also take care of your skin so that it can look and feel its best. Many items on the market make the claim to be skincare items, but they aren't truly. Skincare does not necessarily include anything that leaves you feeling fresh or moisturized.
                Skincare products are made to gradually enhance the condition of your skin. They might contain substances like vitamin C or retinol, which support collagen formation and slow down the aging process.
                Hyaluronic acid, which aids in moisture retention and keeps your skin hydrated all day long, may also be present.
                There are things you can do at home to encourage healthy skin as well as using goods you may buy in stores when it comes to skincare.
                 Once or twice a week, you can apply a face mask to exfoliate the dead skin cells from your face's surface and reveal a new, healthier layer of skin beneath (this is where those masks come in).
                  To get rid of buildup and blackheads,
                  you can also use exfoliating scrubs on places where there are a lot of dead cells (such the area around your nose).
       
               But most significantly, your skincare regiment should be tailored to the requirements of YOUR skin. Decide it as you go, then. Just keep in mind to read frequently and treat your skin gently.</p>

            <h1 class="second-topic">What Belongs to Your Skin Care Carbinet? </h1>
            <p class="second-para">The components of a routine for good skin should then be understood. Which is to say, 
                what kinds of products are actually required to maintain healthy, clean skin?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="third">
            <u><h4 class="third-sub">Cleanser</h4></u>
            <p class="third-para">You'll wash your face with a cleanser, so make sure it's made for faces rather than just using a bar or body wash you happen to have around. 
             You should gently wash your face, being careful not to scrub it. After that, rinse with warm water to avoid stripping your skin of its natural oils and dehydrating it.<br><br>
             It could take some trial and error to find the cleanser that works best for you. You should use one without alcohol or fragrance if you have dry skin.
              If you have oily skin, you should look for an oil-free product, and you might want to think about using a toner as well.<br></p>

            <u><h4 class="third-sub">Toner</h4></u>
            <p class="third-para">After washing your face, apply a toner for smoother, softer, and calmer skin.
              Toners frequently have nutrients that replace and restore your skin's nutrients as well as substances that can lessen redness and dry spots.<br></p>

            <u><h4 class="third-sub">moisturizer</h4></u>
            <p class="third-para">Moisturizers are for everyone and must to be applied after every facial wash, just as cleansers. 
             Similar to finding the appropriate cleanser, some trial and error is totally natural. Oily skin, for instance, can benefit from lightweight, oil-free, or gel solutions.
              Your skin is kept hydrated and smooth by moisturizers because they stop your skin from drying out. When applied to slightly damp skin, they work best at locking in moisture.<br><br></p>

            <u><h4 class="third-sub">Sunscreen</h4></u>
            <p class="third-para">Some moisturizers contain SPF, but it doesn't hurt to use sunscreen in addition, especially if the SPF of your moisturizer is less than 30. You should be familiar with these lines by now:
              Even when it's gloomy or cold or when you're dressed in cover, use sunscreen every day. Every two hours while exposed, reapply. Make sure your sunscreen offers UVA and UVB protection.
               If skin cancer and sun damage aren't enough to persuade you, consider that UV exposure is the leading cause of wrinkles, uneven skin tone, loss of firmness, and other aging symptoms.<br></p>

            <u><h4 class="third-sub">Exfoliation</h4></u>
            <p class="third-para">Here is a product that you might not want to use or need to use every day. If you have dry skin, including skin that has been dried up by the cold air, you may exfoliate more frequently than usual,
              but no more frequently than once or twice a week. Exfoliation helps to remove flaky skin by accelerating skin cell turnover, therefore it can be used after cleansing but before moisturizing.
               The benefits of eliminating buildup and dead skin cells for smoother skin and cleaner pores are genuine, however most dermatologists would advise chemical exfoliants over scrubs to safeguard the skin's protective layer.<br></p>

            <u><h4 class="third-sub">Serum</h4></u>
            <p class="third-para">Serums are an additional optional component of your skin care regimen and contain active compounds like antioxidants or retinol that benefit skin health in a variety of ways,
              including reducing inflammation and enhancing texture and firmness.</p>
